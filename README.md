# International-Debt-Statistics Analysis
Analyze-International-Debt-Statistics (POSTGRESQL)
Debt is not just a personal issue; nations also take on debt to manage various economic necessities such as infrastructure development, healthcare, and education. Organizations like the World Bank provide loans to countries to fund these efforts, particularly in developing nations. In this project, we will analyze the International Debt Statistics dataset collected by the World Bank. The dataset contains information about the debt in USD owed by developing countries, categorized by different indicators over time (from 1970 to 2015).

Using PostgreSQL, we will answer critical questions about the global debt situation, including the total debt owed by countries, identifying the country with the highest debt, and analyzing the average debt owed across various debt indicators
In this project, you are going to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. You are going to find the answers to questions like:

What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset? Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like? What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators? The data used in this project is provided by The World Bank. It contains both national and regional debt statistics for several countries across the globe as recorded from 1970 to 2015. Project Tasks
